    but is best known today for his intellectual pursuits.<br/> Marcus Aurelius  was born on April 26, 121, in Italy, and was chosen 
    by Emporer Hadrian to be his eventual successor.<br/> In 161, Aurelius took control of the Roman Empire along with his brother Verus.
    <br />During his rule, War and disease threatened Rome on all sides. <br /> Aurelius held his territory, but was weakened as a ruler after the death of his brother Verus.
