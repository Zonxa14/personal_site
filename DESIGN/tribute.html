	Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, was a stoic philosopher<br/>
	(26 April 121 â€“ 17 March 180 AD)<br />
   who was born in Italy and became Roman emperor.<br/>
	 <br/>

	 He was chosen by Emporer Hadrian to be his eventual successor.<br/>
	 Marcus kept his empire safe from the Parthians and Germans,<br/>
   but is best known today for his intellectual pursuits.<br/>

	In 161, Marcus took control of the Roman Empire along with his brother Verus.<br/>
  During his rule, War and disease threatened Rome on all sides. <br/>
	<br/>

	Marcus held his territory, but was weakened as a ruler after the death of his brother Verus.<br/>

 <h2>
	 Excerpts from "Meditations"
 </h2>
 <br/>

 <p><b>Book IV number 4</b><br/>
 If the intellectual is common to all men, so is reason, in respect which we are rational beings: <br/>
 if this is so, common also is the reason that commands us what to do, and what not to do; if this is so, there<br/>
 is a common law also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; if this is so, we are members of some political<br/>
 community; if this is so, the world is in a manner a state. For of what other common political community will anyone<br/>
 say that the whole human race are members.<br/>
 <br/>

 <p><b>Book IX number 2</b><br/>
 It would be a man's happiest lot to depart from mankind without having had any taste of lying and hypocrisy and<br/>
 luxury and pride. However, to breathe out one's life when a man has had enough of these things is the next best voyage,<br/>
 as the saying goes.</p>
 <br/>

 <p><b>Book VII number 5</b><br/>
 This is the chief thing: Do not be perturbed, for all things are according to the nature of the universal; and in<br/>
 a little time you will be nobody and nowhere. Like Hadrian and Agustus. In the next place, having fixed your eyes<br/>
 steadily on your business, look at it, at the same time remembering that it is your duty to be a good man,<br/>
 and do what man's nature demands without turning aside; and speak as it seems to you most just, only let it be with<br/>
 a good disposition and with modesty and without hypocrisy.</p>
